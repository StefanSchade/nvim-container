  ** `A` - insert at the end of the line
  ** `o` - open new line below current line

  ** `Esc` or `Ctrl` + `[`
  
=== Replacement Mode

* purpose is replacing text

* **Purpose**: Selecting blocks of text.
* **Transition to Visual Block mode**:
  ** `Ctrl` + `v` - Start visual block mode
* **Transition to Normal mode**:

== Working with Buffers

=== Opening and Creating Buffers

* `:e filename` - open a file as new buffer
* `:new` - open a new empty buffer in a horizontally split window
* `:vnew` - open a new empty buffer in a vertically split window

=== Navigating Buffers

* `:ls` or `:buffers` - list all buffers
* `:bnext` or `:bn` - switch to next buffer
* `:bprev' or `:bp` - switch to previous buffer
* `:bfirst` or `:bf` - switch to first buffer
* `:blast` or `:bl` - switch to last buffer
* `:buffer [N]` - switch to buffer number N
* `:b [Name] - switch to buffer with a specified name
* `:b#` - move to alternate (i.e. last visisted) buffer

=== Deleting and Unloading Buffers

* `:bdelete` or `:bd` - delete current buffer
* `:bd [N]` - delete buffer number N
* `:bwipeot` or `:bw` - wipe out current buffer (removes buffer and associated data)
* `:bw [N]` - wipe out buffer number N


:bufdo if !&modified | bdelete | endif

== Working with Splits

=== creating Splits

* horizontal split `:slit` or `:sp`
* vertical split `:vsplit` or `:vs`

to open split with a specific file each can be complemented with `filename`


* open split with a new file `:new filename`
* open split with a new file `:vnew filename`


=== navigating splits


* move to split above `Ctrl-w k`
* move to split below `Ctrl-w j`
* move to split on the left `Ctrl-w h`
* move to split on the right `Ctrl-w l`
* cycle throguh splits `Ctrl-w w`
* move to a specific split by number `Ctrl-w <number>w`


=== resizing splits

* increase / decrease height `Ctrl-w +` / `Ctrl-w -`
* increase / decrease width `Ctrl-w >` / `Ctrl-w <`
* equalize splits `Ctrl-w =`

=== closing splits

* close current split `:close` or `Ctrl-w c`
* close all others `:only` or `Ctrl-w o`

Command Explanation
wincmd: A prefix used in Vim to execute window commands.
L: Moves the current window to the far right.
K: Moves the current window to the top.
J: Moves the current window to the bottom.
H: Moves the current window to the far left.
Custom Command



Yes, the wincmd commands are native to both Vim and Neovim. They are used to manipulate window layouts directly. You can indeed use these commands interactively in your Neovim session or map them to keys for convenience.

Using wincmd Commands Directly
You can use the wincmd commands directly from the command mode in Neovim. Here's how you can do it:

Enter Command Mode:

Press : to enter command mode.
Execute wincmd Commands:

Type wincmd followed by the command letter (e.g., L, H, J, K).




Key Mappings for Convenience
To make it even more convenient, you can map these commands to specific key combinations in your init.vim or init.lua configuration file. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

For init.vim:

vim
Copy code
" Move current window to the far right
nnoremap <Leader>wr :wincmd L<CR>

" Move current window to the far left
nnoremap <Leader>wl :wincmd H<CR>

" Move current window to the top
nnoremap <Leader>wk :wincmd K<CR>

" Move current window to the bottom
nnoremap <Leader>wj :wincmd J<CR>
For init.lua:

lua
Copy code
-- Move current window to the far right
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', '<Leader>wr', ':wincmd L<CR>', { noremap = true, silent = true })

-- Move current window to the far left
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', '<Leader>wl', ':wincmd H<CR>', { noremap = true, silent = true })

-- Move current window to the top
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', '<Leader>wk', ':wincmd K<CR>', { noremap = true, silent = true })

-- Move current window to the bottom
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', '<Leader>wj', ':wincmd J<CR>', { noremap = true, silent = true })
In these mappings, <Leader> is a placeholder for your leader key (commonly set to \ or ,). You can invoke these commands with <Leader>wr to move the current window to the far right, and so on.



for f in $(ls | grep -v "important_file.txt"); do mv "$f" "_$f"; done
